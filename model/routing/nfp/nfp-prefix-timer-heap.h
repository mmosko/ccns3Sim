/**
 * @ingroup nfp-routing
 *
 * The NfpPrefixTimerHeap keeps an ordered heap of times (Time) for routing advertisements (prefix, anchorName).
 * Whenever NfpRoutingProtocol advertises a (prefix, anchorName), it puts an entry in the heap with the expiry time
 * it wants for the next advertisement.
 *
 * NfpRoutingProtocol can then peak at the top entry in the heap, and if it is expired, pop it off.
 *
 * NfpPrefixTimerHeap will only keep one entry for (prefix, anchorName).  If NfpRoutingProtocol sets a new
 * timer for that pair and one is already in the heap, it will be updated as appropriate.
 *
 * In our actual implementation, we do not do live updates because that would require a linear search of the
 * priority queue to find the old update.  Instead, we have a map by (prefix, anchorName) that stores a reference
 * to the prioirty queue entry and we invalidate it then insert a new entry.  This leaves some crud in the tree
 * that we prune off when it pops to the top.  It is only O(logN), not O(N logN).
