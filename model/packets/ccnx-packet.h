/**
 * @ingroup ccnx-packet
 *
 * CCNx packet representation.  Includes codecs to serialize/deserialize.
 *
 * Class representation of a CCNx Packet, which is the tuple {FixedHeader, PerHopHeaders,
 * Message, ValidationAlg, ValidationSig}.
 *
 * In NS3, each part of the CCNx packet is written as an ns3::Header, so one ends up with at most
 * four ns3::Header per CCNx packet.  At minimum, there are two headers (FixedHeader, Message).
 *
 * The CCNPacket codecs are wire-format compatible with the CCNx specifications.  The main
 * interoperability limitation is that we use CCNxHashValue for KeyId and ContentObjectHash
 * to avoid using cryptographic functions in simulation.  We only use uint64_t, which the
 * user (applications) are responsible for assigning.
 *
 * The Packet carries a virtual uint64_t hash field that can be used to set the ContentObjectHash
 * value of the packet.  This is supposed to be the SHA256 of the (Message, ValidationAlg).  It is
 * carried as a PacketTag so it is not serialized as part of the packet payload.
 *
 * TODO: the virtual hash is not implemented yet.
 *
 * TODO: To access the FixedHeader you have to GetNs3Packet() to serialize it.  That's very expensive.
 *
 * You create a CCNxPacket by using one of the static CreateFromX() methods.
 * This is because there is a problem with overloading constructors in CCNxPacket because they are all flavors
 * of Ptr<foo>, which is ambiguous to the compiler.
 *
 * To pretty print a CCNxPacket, use CCNxPacket::operator <<, such as "std::cout << ccnxPacket".  If it is
 * a Ptr<CCNxPacket>, then use "std::count << *ccnxPacket".
